    <h1>Hobby</h1>

    <p>
      A <strong>hobby</strong> is considered to be a regular activity that is
      done for enjoyment, typically during one's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure " target="_blank">
        <em>leisure time</em> </a
      >. Hobbies include
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collecting" target="_blank">
        <em>collecting</em>
      </a>
      themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits,
      playing
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport" target="_blank">
        <em>sports</em> </a
      >, or pursuing other amusements. Participation in hobbies encourages
      acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. A list of hobbies
      changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse
      and lengthy. Hobbies tend to follow trends in society. For example,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_collecting" target="_blank">
        <em>stamp collecting</em>
      </a>
      was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal
      systems were the main means of communication; as of 2023,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game" target="_blank">
        <em>video games</em>
      </a>
      became more popular following technological advances. The advancing
      production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with
      more leisure time to engage in hobbies. Because of this, the efforts of
      people investing in hobbies has increased with time.

    <h2>Types of hobbies</h2>

    <p>
      Hobbies are a diverse set of activities and it is difficult to categorize
      them in a logical manner. The following categorization of hobbies was
      developed by Stebbins.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Collecting</li>
      <li>Making and tinkering</li>
      <li>Sport</li>
      <li>Liberal arts pursuits</li>
      <li>Computer games</li>
    </ol>
