                This is a war movie but also a movie about relationships in
                wartime. It's good to know about the circumstances that lead to
                the Battle of Narvik in 1940.This film like other worthwhile war
                movies before it, clearly brings to the fore the ugliness of
                war. Man has yet to find a better way to settle differences and
                to rein in his impulse to dominate and subjugate others.

              <p>
                In the end, the most remarkable thing about Against the Ice is
                that a real-life story of two men at the mercy of the
                unforgiving elements, of hunger and illness, possible attack and
                encroaching madness, can be so curiously deprived of tension.
